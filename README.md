## [Cipher Encryption Problem](cipher.ipynb)

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by 3, w, x, y and z would map to z, a, b and c.

## [Difference Pairs Problem](pairs.py)

Given an array of integers and a target value, determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to the target value.

## [Palindrome Index Problem](palindrome_index.ipynb)

Given a string of lowercase letters in the range ascii[a-z], determine the index of a character that can be removed to make the string a palindrome. There may be more than one solution, but any will do. If the word is already a palindrome or there is no solution, return -1. Otherwise, return the index of a character to remove.
